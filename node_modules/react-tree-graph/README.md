================
A simple react component which renders data as a tree using svg.

Check out the [docs](https://jpb12.github.io/react-tree-graph) and the [demo](https://jpb12.github.io/tree-viewer/).

Installing
----------
```sh
npm install react-tree-graph --save
```

Usage
-----

```javascript
import Tree from 'react-tree-graph';

let data = {
	name: 'Parent',
	children: [{
		name: 'Child One'
	}, {
		name: 'Child Two'
	}]
};

<Tree
	data={data}
	height={400}
	width={400}/>);
```

If you are using webpack, and have [css-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader), you can include some default styles with:

```javascript
import 'react-tree-graph/dist/style.css'
```

Alternatively, both the JavaScript and CSS can be included directly from the dist folder with script tags.

Configuration
-------------

| Property | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `data` | object | yes | | The data to be rendered as a tree. Must be in a format accepted by [d3.hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#hierarchy). |
| `margins` | object | | `{ bottom : 10, left : 20, right : 150, top : 10}` | The margins around the content. The right margin should be larger to include the rendered label text. |
| `height` | number | yes | | The height of the rendered tree, including margins. |
| `width` | number | yes | | The width of the rendered tree, including margins. |
| `animated` | boolean | | false | If true, the tree will animate. |
| `duration` | number | | 500 | The duration in milliseconds of animations. |
| `easing` | function(interval) | | [d3-ease](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-ease).easeQuadOut | The easing function for animations. Takes in a number between 0 and 1 and returns a number between 0 and 1. |
| `steps` | number | | 20 | The number of steps in animations. |
| `getChildren` | function(node) | | node => node.children | A function that returns the children for a node, or null/undefined if no children exist |
| `keyProp` | string | | `"name"` | The property on each node to use as a key. |
| `labelProp` | string | | `"name"` | The property on each node to render as label text. |
| `treeClassName` | string | | | The class to add to the `<svg>` element containing the tree. |
| `treeClickHandler` | function(event) | | | A function called when the tree is clicked. |
| `linkClassName` | string | | `"link"` | The class to add to each `<path>` element linking two nodes. |
| `linkClickHandler` | function(sourceKey, targetKey, event) | | | A function called when a link is clicked. |
| `nodeClassName` | string | | `"node"` | The class to add to each `<g>` element, representing a node. |
| `nodeClickHandler` | function(nodeKey, event) | | | A function called when a node is clicked. |
| `nodeOffset` | number | | `3.5` | The height offset for the label of a node. May need to be adjusted depending on radius and font size. |
| `nodeRadius` | number | | `5` | The radius of the rendered node. |

Node properties can be set for individual nodes by setting them on the node with the following mapping:

| Global | Node |
|:---|:---|
| `nodeClassName` | `className` |
| `nodeClickHandler` | `onClick` |
| `nodeOffset` | `offset` |
| `nodeRadius` | `radius` |
